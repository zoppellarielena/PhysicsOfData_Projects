# Chen et al., *Character-Centric Story Visualization via Visual Planning and Token Alignment*, 2022 paper presentation
In this presentation, we discuss the 2022 paper by Chen et al. titled "Character-Centric Story Visualization via Visual Planning and Token Alignment." 
The paper, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08465, addresses the challenge of generating images for a story using a text-to-image framework.

The key focus of this paper is to preserve the characters' representation accurately. 
To achieve this, the authors propose an approach that combines a Vector-Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) augmented with a language model (GPT-2). 
Additionally, they introduce a character token planning model to predict visual tokens specifically for characters and a visual token completion model to generate the remaining visual token sequence.

By incorporating character-centric planning and token alignment, the paper presents an innovative solution to enhance the generation of images in storytelling scenarios. 
This presentation provides an overview of the paper's methodology, key findings, and potential implications in the field of natural language processing.

This presentation has been developed and discuss in May 2023 for *Natural Language Processing* course offered by the University of Padova (academic year 2022-2023).
