# Multinomial Naive Bayes for Fake News Classification
This project focuses on the application of Multinomial Naive Bayes for the classification of fake news. 
The first part of the project involves classifying news articles into five classes (Barely-True, False, Half-True, Mostly True, Not-Known, True). 
The classification accuracy achieved in this part is relatively low, with only 23.77% correct predictions.

In the second part of the project, a different dataset with binary fake news classification (true/false) was used for classification. 
The results obtained in this case demonstrate a significant improvement, with 92.51% of the samples correctly classified.

The datasets used in this project can be found at the following links:

This project was implemented in July/August 2022 in the R language as part of the *Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis* course offered by the University of Padova (academic year 2021-2022).
