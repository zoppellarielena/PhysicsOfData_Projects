# Physics of Data projects

This is a collection of projects and exercises completed during my pursuit of a Master's degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padova. The list is organized in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent work and progressing towards older projects:

1. **PROJECT for NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING course (prof. Satta):** This project focused on Neural Dependency Parsing using biLSTM compared to BERT for feature extraction, utilizing ArcEager as the Parser algorithm. The implementation was done using PyTorch.
2. **PAPER PRESENTATION for NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING course (prof. Satta):** In this presentation, the 2022 paper by Chen et al. titled "Character-Centric Story Visualization via Visual Planning and Token Alignment" is discussed. The paper, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08465, addresses the challenge of generating images for a story using a text-to-image framework.

3. **REPORTS for STOCHASTIC METHODS FOR FINANCE course (prof. Grasselli):** This section comprises a series of reports covering various financial mathematics topics, accompanied by VBA scripts for data analysis.

4. **PROJECT for NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING course (prof. Pegoraro):** The project explored the comparison between conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for Image Colorization. PyTorch was employed for the implementation.

5. **EXERCISES for MACHINE LEARNING course (prof. Zanuttigh):** This section includes a collection of Python exercises focused on machine learning basic concepts.

6. **PROJECT for ADVANCED STATISTICS FOR PHYSICS ANALYSIS course (prof. Garfagnini):** For this project, a Naive Bayes Model was developed to classify Fake News. The implementation was carried out using R.

7. **PROJECT for LABORATORY OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS MOD B course (prof. Baiesi, supervisor: prof. Carlo Albert):** This project involved the implementation of an Encoder-Decoder Architecture for catchment features in river runoff time-series. Keras in TensorFlow was utilized for the implementation.

8. **EXERCISES for ADVANCED STATISTICS FOR PHYSICS ANALYSIS course (prof. Garfagnini):** Here, you will find a range of exercises in R covering various basic and advanced statistical topics.

9. **PROJECT for LABORATORY OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS MOD A course (prof. Zanetti and prof. Mapelli):** The aim of this project is to use graphical and machine learning tools to figure out what features have the highest impact on the fate of a binary black hole in Nuclear Star Clusters (NSC), Globular Clusters (GC) and Young Star Clusters (YSC).

This collection shows how my work has grown and improved over time, demonstrating my increasing knowledge and skills in the field of computational physics, machine learning and data analysis throughout my academic journey.
