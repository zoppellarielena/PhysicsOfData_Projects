# Physics of Data projects

This is a collection of projects and exercises completed during my pursuit of a Master's degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padova. The list is organized in reverse chronological order, starting from the most recent work and progressing towards older projects:

1. **PROJECT: MINIBATCH K-MEANS CLUSTERING ON RCV1 DATASET USING DASK**<br> Developed for the *Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset Mod. B* course, this project explores efficient methods for handling a massive 250GB dataset using the **Dask** library. The goal is to perform clustering on a dataset containing over 800k RCV1 articles. The project includes an attempt to reduce the RCV1 dataset by considering articles belonging to a specific macrocategory and an implemetation of cosine similarity instead of euclidean distance for clustering, following Natural Language Processing suggestions.
  
2. **PROJECT: NEURAL DEPENDENCY PARSING USING biLSTM COMPARED TO BERT FOR FEATURES EXTRAXTION**<br> Completed as part of the *Natural Language Processing* course, this project employs the ArcEager parsing algorithm. Implementation is carried out using **PyTorch** and the **Hugging Face** library for utilizing pretrained **BERT models**.
   
3. **PAPER PRESENTATION: *Character-Centric Story Visualization via Visual Planning and Token Alignment* BY CHEN ET AL., 2022**<br> This presentation, conducted for the *Natural Language Processing* course, delves into the paper's content, which addresses the challenge of generating images for a story using a text-to-image framework. The paper can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08465.

4. **REPORTS for *STOCHASTIC METHODS FOR FINANCE* course**<br> This section comprises a collection of reports covering various topics in advanced financial mathematics. Accompanying the reports are **Visual Basic for Applications scripts** used for data analysis on Excel.

5. **PROJECT: CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSIAL NETWORK (cGAN) and WASSERSTEIN cGAN (WGAN) FOR IMAGE COLORIZATION**<br> Developed for the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course, this project utilizes **PyTorch** for GAN implementation.
  
6. **EXERCISES for *MACHINE LEARNING* course**<br> In this section, you'll find a set of Python exercises focused on fundamental machine learning concepts using **scikit-learn** library.

7. **PROJECT: NAIVE BAYES MODEL FOR FAKE NEWS CLASSIFICATION**<br> Developed for the Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis course, the implementation is carried out using the **R language**.

8. **PROJECT: AUTOENCODER ARCHITECTURE FOR CATCHMENT FEATURES IN RIVER RUNOFF TIME-SERIES**<br> Completed for the *Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. B* under the supervision of Professor Carlo Albert. The project utilizes **Keras in TensorFlow** for implementation.

9. **EXERCISES for *ADVANCED STATISTICS FOR PHYSICS ANALYSIS* course**<br> This section presents a variety of exercises in **R language** covering both basic and advanced statistical topics.

10. **PROJECT: WHICH FEATURES HAVE THE HIGHEST IMPACT ON THE FATE OF A BINARY BLACK HOLES?**<br> Developed for the *Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. A*, this project employs graphical and machine learning tools to identify the features with the greatest impact on the fate of binary black holes in Nuclear Star Clusters (NSC), Globular Clusters (GC), and Young Star Clusters (YSC).
