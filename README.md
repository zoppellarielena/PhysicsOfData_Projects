# Physics Of Data Projects
This is a collection of projects and exercises completed during my pursuit of a Master's degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padova.
It is organized in reverse chronological order, from the most recent work to the older ones:
- PROJECT for NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING course (prof. Satta): Neural Dependency Parsing using biLSTM vs BERT for Feature Representation, using ArcEager as Parser. Implemented using Pytorch.
- REPORTS for STOCHASTIC METHODS FOR FINANCE course (prof. Grasselli): a collection of reports about financial mathematic topics, paired with VBA scripts for data analysis.
- PROJECT for NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING course (prof. Pegoraro): conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) vs Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for Image Colorization. Implemented using Pytorch.
- EXERCISES for MACHINE LEARNING course (prof. Zanuttigh): simple exercises in Python.
- PROJECT for ADVANCED STATISTICS FOR PHYSICS ANALYSIS course (prof. Garfagnini): Naive Bayes Model for Fake News identification. Implemented in R.
- EXERCISES for ADVANCED STATISTICS FOR PHYSICS ANALYSIS course (prof. Garfagnini): a collection of exercises in R about various basic and advanced statistical topics.
- PROJECT for LABORATORY OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS MOD B course (supervisor: prof. Carlo Albert):
